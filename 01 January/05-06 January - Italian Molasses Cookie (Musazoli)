05-06 January - Italian Molasses Cookie (Musazoli) 
- 12  oz dark molasses
- 1   cup sugar
- 3   eggs
- 3/4 cup vegetable oil
- 6   cups flour 
- 6   teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1   tablespoon grated orange zest
- sesame seeds
- 3/4 cup chopped nuts (optional)

Preheat oven to 375F and grease a cookie sheet.
Beat molasses, eggs and sugar together. Add orange zest and vegetable oil and if using nuts add those as well. 
Mix dry ingredients together and add to the molasses mix a little at a time for a soft dough. Knead together on floured surface until smooth. Spread sesame seeds on board. Make long rolls and roll dough over sesame seeds. You can grease hands with oil or Crisco as dough will be sticky. Place on greased cookie sheet and bake in preheated oven for 8-10 minutes. Cool and cut into slants. 


Editor's note: when looking up musazoli (spelled mustazzoli everywhere else) I found recipes using vino cotto (cooked wine or wine molasses) along with cloves and cinnamon along with the orange zest.
