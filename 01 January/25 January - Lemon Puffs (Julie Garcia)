25 January - Lemon Puffs (Julie Garcia)

- 1 package puff pastry sheet
- 1 box confectioners sugar (Editor's note: no idea how much this is supposed to be?)
- 1 egg
- 1 stick butter or margarine
- 1 teaspoon lemon extract

Sheet pastry comes folded in thirds. Follow directions and thaw a bit, then separate sheet and cut each third into roughly 1" strips (about 8 for each third - cut each third in half, then those in half again and those in once more). Follow baking directions which is about 10-12 minutes in a 400F oven. 

Mix egg, butter, and sugar until creamy. Do not cook. Add lemon extract by starting with 3/4 teaspoon and adding more to taste if desired. Slice baked pastry puffs lengthwise, filling with filling, put the cover back on like a sandwich. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar.
