# Recipe Calendar

My grandmother has a recipe book written in a day planner from 1986. My uncle gave me a photocopied version of it, and I have painstakingly
transcribed it for easier reading. So a copy of a copy, but at least this one is legible. 

Anything prefaced with "Editor's note:" is me, and I did some very light editing - usually just moving the ingredient list to the top of the recipe 
and adjusting the sentences thereafter to reference the item and not the item and amount. The recipes themselves have 
notes as well - either from my grandmother, the person she got the recipe from, or from my uncle who has added a few comments to recipes 
he did and did not enjoy. If I get real bored I may scan in the photocopied version I have as a comparison, and if I get _especially_ bored I'll throw in
some photos of the end results of the recipes I've tried. No promises, I haven't even finished formatting this yet so we'll see.
