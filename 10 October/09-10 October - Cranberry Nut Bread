- 2     cup flour
- 1     cup sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2   teaspoon baking soda

- 1     egg, well beaten
- 1 1/2 chopped cranberries

Sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Cut in shortening until mixture is like coarse cornmeal. In a separate bowl, combine orange juice, rind and egg. Pour into dry mix and stir just enough to dampen dry ingredients. Carefully fold in cranberries and nuts. Spoon into greased loaf pans. Spread to corners and sides of pan slightly higher than center. Bake in a preheated oven 350F about 1 hour or until done.
