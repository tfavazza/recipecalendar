19-20 September Portuguese Sweet Bread (Easter)

- 6-7 cup flour
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1   cup milk
- 3/4 stick butter
- 1   cup sugar + 1 teaspoon sugar
- 2   packages yeast
- 4   large eggs
- 1/2 cup lukewarm water

Combine yeast, water, and 1 teaspoon sugar and let stand. Beat eggs in a large bowl. In a small pan combine milk, salt, butter and sugar, stir over low heat until milk is warm (butter need not melt). Gradually stir into eggs then beat in about 1 1/2 cup flour, add in yeast mixture and beat until smooth. Gradually add enough remaining flour to make a dough. Turn onto lightly floured board and knead 8-10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover and let rise about 1 1/2 hours. Punch down and divide into 2 loaves and bake in a preheated 325F oven for about 40 minutes or until done.
