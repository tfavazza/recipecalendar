17-18 February - Sour Cream Strudel Dough (Bessie)

Dough
<pre>- 4 cup flour
- 1 lb margarine or butter
- 1 lb sour cream
</pre>
Filling
<pre>- apricot preserves
- dried coconut
- chopped nuts
</pre>
Mix together flour and butter. Add sour cream. Dough will be soft but do NOT add more flour. Instead add flour to hands and make about 10 balls of dough - put dough into baggies and refrigerate or freeze until needed. 

Roll out dough very thin and spread apricot preserves. Sprinkle with coconut and chopped nuts. Roll as if a jelly roll and bake in a 400F preheated oven for about 20 minutes or until lightly browned. Cut into diagonal strips while still warm. You can shake powdered sugar over the roll.
