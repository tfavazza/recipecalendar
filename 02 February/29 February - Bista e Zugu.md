_Editors Note: This was not in the recipe calendar, but was transcribed by Joel sometime in the early 200s after spending a few Sundays watching Grandma, Papa, and Auntie all make Sunday dinner. 
The sauce doesn't really work without the meat included, and you should expect to lose a few meatballs in the sauce._
