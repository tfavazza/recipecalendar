19 August - Crescent Filled Cookies (cream cheese)

- 2 1/2 cup flour
- 2 sticks butter
- 8 oz cream cheese
- 1 egg yolk


<p> <i> Editor's note: Since this and the recipe before look like they were written at the same time, I'm guessing this should also have a filling (Fill with sugar, cinnamon, fruit-jelly etc).</i> </p>

<p>Mix altogether and store in refrigerator for 24 hours. Make a circle with dough and cut in pie shape wedges. 
Use flour and sugar to roll out dough. Bake at 375 about 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. </p>
