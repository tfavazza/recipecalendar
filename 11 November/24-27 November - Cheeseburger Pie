24-27 November - Cheeseburger Pie

- 1     lb ground beef
- 3/4   cup Jiffy mix (editor's note: probably all purpose baking mix?)
- 1 1/2 cup milk
- 3     eggs
-       salt and pepper to taste
- 2     onions
- 1     tomato, sliced
- 1     cup shredded cheese

Brown hamburger and onions, drain off fat. Stir in salt and pepper and spread in greased pie plate. Mix milk, Jiffy mix and eggs until smooth. Pour over beef mix and bake in a 400F preheated oven for 25 minutes. Take pie out of oven and top with tomato slices and cheese. Bake for about 5 minutes more.
