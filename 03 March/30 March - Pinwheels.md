30 March - Pinwheels

- 1 package yeast
- 3 cups of flour 
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/3 cup shortening
- cherry or raspberry preserves

Oven 350F, makes 24 pinwheels

In a large mixer bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups of flour, yeast, sugar, and salt; mix well. Heat water and butter until very warm (130F, butter does not need to melt). Add to flour mixture. Add eggs. Blend at low speed until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed. By hand, gradually stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate 6-12 hours. 
While dough is chilling punch down several times. 
Allow dough to come to room temperature. Divide dough into 2 parts. Roll each part into a 10 5x14" rectangle. Cut into 3.5" squares. Place on greased baking sheets. Cut each square diagonally from each corner to about 1/2" of center. Place rounded spoon of preserves in center. There are now two points to each corner. Lightly brush every other point with egg wash (1 egg and 1 tablespoon water slightly beaten). Bring moistened points toward center, gently twist and pinch to fasten together. Top each center with a small piece of dough, about 1/2" in diameter or use a candied cherry for extra decoration. 
Lightly cover; let rise at room temperature until almost doubled, 10-15 minutes (15-20 for active dry yeast). Bake 15 minutes at 350F or until golden brown. Remove to wire rack, let cool slightly. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar.
