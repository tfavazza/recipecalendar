27 March - Italian Easter Bread

- 5   cup sifted all purpose flour
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 2   tablespoon grated lemon peel
- 1   teaspoon salt
- 2   package active dry yeast
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 cup soft butter or margarine
- 2   eggs
- 1/2 cup white raisins
- 12  raw eggs in shell, colored with pure food coloring
- egg glaze (recipe follows)

In a large bowl of electric mixer, mix 1 1/2 cup flour, sugar, lemon peel, salt and yeast. Place milk, water and butter in a saucepan over moderately low heat and heat until liquids are warm and butter is melted. Gradually add liquid to dry ingredients and beat two minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Add eggs and 3/4 cup of flour, or enough to make a thick batter. With a spoon, stir in enough of remaining flour to make a soft dough. Turn out onto floured board and knead for 8-10 minutes adding flour as needed to prevent sticking. Shape into ball and place in greased bowl turning once. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in bulk. Punch-down and turn out onto floured board. Knead in raisins. Cover and let rise 15 minutes. Divide into four equal portions and roll each into an even 28" rope. On a greased cookie sheet, loosely twist two of the ropes together six times and bring ends together to form a circle. Seal ends firmly. Between the twists of the ropes, shape six nests and insert a colored egg in each. Make a second ring and do the same. Cover with a sheet of greased wax paper and let rise until doubled. Brush with egg glaze. Bake in a preheated 375F oven for 25-30 minutes, or until golden. Serve hot. Cut between the eggs and serve each person an egg and the bread around it. Serves 12 (The eggs can be used in the recipes above).
