24 March - Fettuccine all'Gianna

This is a variation on Fettuccine all'Fredo.

Cut your homemade pasta into strips about a quarter of an inch thick. Boil it and remove it slightly underdone. 

Ingredients (very approximate)

- 1/4 lb unsalted butter
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder or clove, mashed
- 1/4 cup parsley flakes
- 1   pint medium cream
- 1/2 cup grated Italian cheese
- 2   eggs
-     salt and pepper to taste

Melt butter, about 1/8 lb, in pan. Add garlic and simmer briefly. Parsley may be simmered as well or added later. Put drained fettuccine in a sauce pan and toss to coat with butter sauce. Add rest of butter pat at a time to melt and help coat pasta. Have eggs beaten and added to cream, whisked together along with salt and pepper. Add this mixture to the noodles and stir quickly. Add grated cheese. Sauce will thicken slightly and bubble. Don't overcook. Add parsley if you didn't do so before. Serve with grated cheese.
